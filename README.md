# Python linux command

Provide the functions of os/shutil with the same name used in linux commands.

I am a Linux fan, but loves Python so much. Each time I call the functions such
as shutil.copyfile, I have to take two seconds to think about the name. Why not
the same to linux command cp? That is the reason to have this python module.

Note: This module only support Python 3.5+ and Linux.
